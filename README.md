Console Application Skeloton
======

If you need a console application fast, or just need to do something requiring more than a script, clone the skeloton, remove the github remote repository, and you are good to go.

```
git clone git@github.com:gulyasm/console.git
sh install.sh
```
install.sh removes the github remote repository.
