Console Application Skeloton
======

If you need a console application fast, or just need to do something requiring more than a script, clone the skeloton, remove the github remote repository, and you are good to go.
The skeloton takes care about the guava dependency, contains dummy input and output console parameters. Usage and exception handling for parameters also taken care of. 

```
git clone git@github.com:gulyasm/console.git
sh install.sh
```
install.sh removes the github remote repository.
